# Switch Mode Power Supply

This is a GitHub repo displaying all the files for the 2025 Cooper Union senior project, including the LTSpice simulations, firmware, testing procedures, and any final design files (block diagram, schematic, layout, etc.) for any boards manufactured. 

## Goals
The goal of this senior project is to make a Switch Mode Power Supply that can:
- Be SAFE (the 120V from the wall will be stepped down to 24V RMS using a transformer)
- Do AC-DC conversion so it can be used as a lab bench power supply
- Have 2 independent channels that range from 1-20V and 0-3A
- Support series and parallel mode for these channels
- Have a constant USB-C 5V 3A output
- Be power efficient
    - Based on the lab bench Gwinstek SMPS SPD-3606, a good target efficiency is 50%
- Low voltage ripple (<1%)

## Circuitry
Some of the circuitry for the project include:
- Safety Circuits
    - Common mode choke
    - Zener diodes
    - OVP
    - OCP
    - UVP
- Diode Rectifier
- Flyback converter
- Buck converter
- Opto-Isolators
- Power MOSFETs and power relays
- USB-C controller
- Feedback loop using an error amplifier
- 3 isolated grounds

## Firmware
Two ESP32 Dev Modules processing feedback and driving the circuit.
